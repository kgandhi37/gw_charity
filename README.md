# Suggestions Form

A really quick and basic suggestions "app" built with AngularJS & PHP.

Simple functionality, can post to database. Items in database are shown in a table with a filter option.

Obvious improvements can be made but it does what it needs to, there was an immediate basic need.

Both Name and Suggestion fields are required.

__Potentially to do__

- Better verification of names
- Allow multi-line suggestions (allow line breaks)
- Auto update table when posted instead of reloading whole page
- CSS and UI
etc etc
